This project concerns the development of a set of algorithms for solving the fleet 
assignment problem under additional constraints:
    - Limited capacity of fleets
    - Minimum load for fleets
    - Green capacity of fleets
    - Stochastic demand and stochastic productivity
    
This problem is completely new in scientific literature and the proposed solutions 
are supporteed and validated by a case study based on real data.
